## Overview

This TypeScript project is a desktop-friendly web app developed as a personal initiative to demonstrate my skills and interest in web development. The primary goal is to use this project as an opportunity to apply for the internship at Budgetwise. This project serves as a testament to my abilities in creating visually appealing web applications.

## Features

- **Savings Goals:** The app includes a section to manage and display savings goals, allowing users to track their progress towards financial objectives.

- **Recent Transactions:** Users can view and analyze their recent transactions, categorized by type, with detailed information for each transaction.

- **Bank and Credit Card Information:** The app provides a clear overview of the user's bank and credit card details, including the bank's name, the last four digits of the card, and the account balance.

- **Six-Month Bar Graph:** A visual representation of expenses over a six-month period, utilizing Chart.js for dynamic and interactive bar graphs.

## Unfinished Tasks

While the majority of the project has been completed successfully, there are a few outstanding tasks:

1. **2K Marker Flexibility:** The 2K marker currently looks optimal on a 15-inch screen, and further adjustments are needed for responsiveness on different devices.

2. **Visible X and Y Borders:** The X and Y axis borders are still visible and need refinement for a cleaner presentation.

3. **Aug Label Styling:** The August label on the X axis lacks the expected styling, with a purple background and white text, requiring attention.

## Learning Experience

This project has been a valuable learning experience, especially in the following areas:

- **Chart.js Implementation:** I gained hands-on experience in creating bar graphs using Chart.js, broadening my understanding of data visualization in web applications.

- **Web Development Skills:** The project allowed me to apply and enhance my web development skills, including TypeScript, React, and styling with CSS.
